:- comment(module,"@apl{ciaosh} is the CIAO interactive top-level shell.
It provides the user an interactive programming environment with tools
for incrementally building programs, debugging programs by following
their executions, and modifying parts of programs without having to
start again from scratch.  If available, it is strongly recommended to
use it with the @concept{emacs interface} provided, as it greatly
simplifies the operation.  This chapter documents general operation in
the shell. Subsequent chapters document the relevant exported
predicates of the modules which provide functionalities to the shell.

@section{Shell invocation and startup}

When invoked, the shell responds with a message of identification and
the prompt @tt{?- } as soon as it is ready to accept input, thus:

@begin{verbatim}
CIAO 0.9 #21: Thu Mar 25 17:20:55 MET 1999
?- 
@end{verbatim}

When the shell is initialized it looks for a file @file{.ciaorc} in the
HOME directory and makes an @tt{include} of it, if it exists.  This file
is useful for including @decl{use_module/1} declarations for the modules
one wants to be loaded by default, changing @concept{prolog flag}s, etc.
If the initialization file does not exist, the @concept{ISO-Prolog}
compatibility package @lib{iso} is included, to provide (almost) all the
ISO builtins by default.  Two command-line options control the loading of
the initialization file:

@begin{description}

@item{@tt{-f}} Fast start, do not load any initialization file.

@item{@tt{-l} @var{File}} Look for initialization file @var{File}
  instead of @tt{~/.ciaorc}. If it does not exist, include the
  compatibility package @tt{iso}.

@end{description}

@section{Shell interaction}

After the shell outputs the prompt, it is expecting either an internal
command (see the following sections) or a @index{query} (a goal or
sequence of goals).  When typing in the input, which must be a valid
prolog term, if the term does not end in the first line, subsequent
lines are indented.  For example:

@begin{verbatim}
?- X =
   f(a,
   b).

X = f(a,b) ? 

yes
?- 
@end{verbatim}

The queries are executed by the shell as if they appeared in the
@concept{user module}.  Thus, in addition to builtin predicates, predicates
available to be executed directly are all predicates defined by loaded
user files (files with no module declaration), and imported predicates from
modules by the use of @tt{use_module}.

The possible answers of the shell, after executing an internal command or
query, are:

@begin{itemize}

@item If the execution failed (or produced an error), the answer is
      @tt{no}.

@item If the execution was successful, and no @concept{answer
      variable} (see below) was bound (or constraints where imposed on
      such variables), the answer is simply @tt{yes}.

@item If the execution was successful and bindings where made (or
      constraints where imposed) on @concept{answer variable}s, then
      the shell outputs the values of answer variables, as a sequence
      of bindings (or constraints), and then prints a @tt{?} as a
      prompt.  At this point it is expecting an input line from the
      user.  By entering a carriage-return (@key{RET}) or any line
      starting with @tt{y}, the query terminates and the shell answer
      @tt{yes}.  Entering a `@tt{,}' the shell enters a
      @concept{recursive level} (see below).  Finally, any other
      answer forces the system to backtrack and look for the next
      solution (answering as with the first solution).

@end{itemize}

To allow using connection variables in queries without having to
report their results, variables whose name starts with @tt{_} are not
considered in answers, the rest being the @index{answer variable}s.
This example illustrates the previous points:

@begin{verbatim}
?- member(a, [b, c]).

no
?- member(a, [a, b]).

yes
?- member(X, [a|L]).

X = a ? ;

L = [X|_] ? 

yes
?- atom_codes(ciao, _C), member(L, _C).

L = 99 ? ;

L = 105 ? ;

L = 97 ? ;

L = 111 ? ;

no
?- 
@end{verbatim}

@section{Entering recursive (conjunctive) shell levels}

As stated before, when the user answers with `@tt{,}' after a solution
is presented, the shell enters a @index{recursive level}, changing its
prompt to @em{N} @tt{?- } (where @em{N} is the recursion level) and
keeping the bindings or constraints of the solution (this is inspired
by the @index{LogIn} language developed by @index{H. Ait-Kaci},
@index{P. Lincoln} and @index{Roger Nasr} @cite{E-overview}).  Thus,
the following queries will be executed within that context, and all
variables in the lower level solutions will be reported in subsequent
solutions at this level.  To exit a recursive level, input an
@key{EOF} character or the command @tt{up}.  The last solution after
entering the level is repeated, to allow asking for more solutions.
Use command @tt{top} to exit all recursive levels and return to the
top level.  Example interaction:

@begin{verbatim}
?- directory_files('.',_Fs), member(F,_Fs).

F = 'file_utils.po' ? ,

1 ?- file_property(F, mod_time(T)).

F = 'file_utils.po',
T = 923497679 ? 

yes
1 ?- up.

F = 'file_utils.po' ? ;

F = 'file_utils.pl' ? ;

F = 'file_utils.itf' ? ,

1 ?- file_property(F, mod_time(T)).

F = 'file_utils.itf',
T = 923497679 ? 

yes
1 ?- ^D
F = 'file_utils.itf' ? 

yes
?- 
@end{verbatim}
